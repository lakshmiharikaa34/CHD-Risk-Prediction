# 🫀 CHD Risk Prediction

This repository contains resources for predicting the **10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** using machine learning.  
The project aims to analyze key health factors such as **age, cholesterol, smoking habits, blood pressure, and diabetes** to identify individuals at risk.

Understanding these factors can help in **early detection** and **preventive measures**, contributing to better cardiovascular health outcomes.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project follows a **structured pipeline** to analyze CHD risk factors and build a predictive model:

✔ **Data Preparation** – Cleaning data, handling missing values, and treating outliers.  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding variable distributions and correlations.  
✔ **Feature Selection & Engineering** – Identifying key predictors of CHD risk.  
✔ **Model Training & Evaluation** – Building a machine learning model and assessing performance.  
✔ **Deployment** – Saving the trained model for easy reuse.  

This model helps in **understanding risk factors** and can be extended for **real-world applications** in cardiovascular health.

## 📊 Key Insights from the Analysis

🔹 **Age and smoking habits** show a strong correlation with CHD risk.  
🔹 **Higher cholesterol and blood pressure levels** significantly increase the likelihood of CHD.  
🔹 **Diabetes and hypertension** are major contributing factors to cardiovascular health issues.  
🔹 The machine learning model helps identify **high-risk individuals**, enabling early intervention.  

These findings emphasize the need for **regular health screenings, lifestyle modifications, and medical intervention** to lower CHD risk.
