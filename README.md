# ðŸ«€ CHD Risk Prediction

This repository contains resources for predicting the **10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** using machine learning.  
The project aims to analyze key health factors such as **age, cholesterol, smoking habits, blood pressure, and diabetes** to identify individuals at risk.

Understanding these factors can help in **early detection** and **preventive measures**, contributing to better cardiovascular health outcomes.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

âœ” **Data Preparation** â€“ Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection.  
âœ” **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Understanding patterns and correlations in health indicators.  
âœ” **Machine Learning Model** â€“ A predictive model trained to classify CHD risk.  
âœ” **Model Deployment** â€“ The trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file for easy reuse.  

This project helps in **understanding risk factors** and can be extended for **real-world applications** in cardiovascular risk assessment.
